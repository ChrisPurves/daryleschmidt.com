				<h2>Teaching Positive Ways To Get Positive Results</h2>
				<p>Hi, my name is Daryle Schmidt. I own and run <em><strong>Daryle Schmidt
							Dog Training Centre</strong></em> which is located 3 miles north of Drayton Valley,
					Alberta and 3.5 miles east of Highway #22. If you travel through
					Rocky Rapids continue 2.5 miles east of the Rocky Rapids Store and
					you will find us on the south side of the road.</p>
				<p>I'm offering a variety of services which include: one on one
					lessons teaching <strong>Basic Dog Obedience</strong>, I provide a service when
					you are on holidays to train your dog while your dog is boarded here,
					a walking / training service, and I also train working stock dogs.
					My methods are the latest in dog psychology training. I teach
					people to understand <strong>how</strong> their dog thinks and <strong>why</strong> they react in a
					certain manner.</p>
				<p>You can come to my training centre for lessons or I can come to
					your home. If your dog needs additional training to over come
					engrained behaviours and habits I can take your dog to my training
					centre until he is ready to return home.</p>
				<p>Together as a group effort I can help you solve problems by
					teaching you positive ways to get positive results. I will show you
					<strong>how</strong> to correct unwanted behaviour and <strong>when</strong> to give praise.</p>
