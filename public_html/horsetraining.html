<h2>Daryle Schmidt Horse Training Centre</h2>


<p>The training centre is located 7km NE&nbsp;of Drayton
Valley near
the town of Rocky Rapids. The facility includes a 210 x 155 ft outdoor
arena, round pen, heated barn and turnout pens. &nbsp;All clients
have
access to a beautiful basketball court,&nbsp;tennis court and
playground.&nbsp;Children
can&nbsp;entertain&nbsp;themselves on the
playground while you ride.&nbsp;</p>


Daryle has spent the last 20 years sharing his knowledge of
horses
with others. Clinics, private and group lessons are held throughout
western Canada. Clinics available include colt starting, advanced colt
starting, horsemanship and reining. Daryle is more than an experienced
horse trainer, he is a great teacher. You will experience instruction
which is clear and easy to follow. Horses and participants come away
with confidence from learning the basics in ground work and
riding.&nbsp;
<p>The majority of Daryles&rsquo; training has been starting
colts.
Daryle has developed a <span style="font-weight: bold;">progressive,
step- by-step colt starting program</span>
which produces quiet, dependable horses. Ray Hunt has had the biggest
influence on how he&nbsp;starts each horse. Daryle firmly believes
that
&ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">the key to
success in training horses is by developing a
solid
foundation</span>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>


Quote <span style="font-style: italic;">"Daryle
is one of Western Canada's greatest undiscovered talents in the area of
horse training" (Reg Luster, Meadow Lake, SK)</span>
