<h2>Training All Breeds</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the first two months of training I want to
build a
"foundation" through teaching my&nbsp; 24-step <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"Basic Ground Training Program".</span>
Basic Ground Training<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>will
take
approximately 4-5 weeks on an average 2 year old.The time it takes to
teach
this initial
training varies from horse to horse, depending on the age, breed,
bloodlines, disposition, and the style of handling the horse has been
exposed to prior to arrival. It may take 6-8 weeks
to change the patterns and
attitude of an older horse or stallion as more time is needed to
maintain their focus and accept training. Basic ground training sets
the stage for
how willingly your horse accepts the lessons in my <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"Basic Riding Program". </span>Riding
starts 4-6 weeks into the "Basic Ground Training Program".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foundation I want to build during the
first months of training is a series of simple maneuvers that are the
basis of all good
riding. I want a young horse to walk, trot, lope and back up on a loose
rein and guide well by giving his head softly in both directions. He
should
lope a nice circle with his body between the
bridle reins, not pulling in or out of the circle. I want him to lope a
straight line without veering left or right and&nbsp; lope across the
pasture on
a loose rein with no signs of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>running
off. At this time I do not teach any hard fast stops
or turnarounds.</p>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Goals to achieve during
the 1st Month of Training</span>
<ul>
  <li>Basic Ground Training Lessons [ as shown above]&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Change bad habits and patterns</li>
  <li>Teach horse to accept training</li>
  <li>Allow time for the horse to settle into the daily routine</li>
  <li>Become familiar with being tied up in the barn and wash rack
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ride when horse is ready&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
All "Basic Ground Training" is first taught with a rope halter. The
young horse must understand and be cooperative before I progress to a
snaffle bit.&nbsp; I believe it is important to initially teach
everything on
the ground before riding, so when I get on their back the horse
understands what I
am asking.<br />

Each horse has varying degrees of
athletic ability, strengths and weaknesses. My job as a trainer is to
teach and develop them at a pace that is appropriate for your
individual horse.<br />
