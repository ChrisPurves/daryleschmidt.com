<h3>Types of Clinics &amp; Lessons</h3>



<ul>



  <li><span class="style_bold">Colt Starting</span><br />



    <span class="style_italic">Any horse from a weanling
to an&nbsp;older horse&nbsp;can be enrolled in this clinic.</span><br />



This colt starting program is designed to keep you safe while preparing
your horse for saddling and then riding. Colts between the
ages of 2-4 are typically enrolled, however horses of all ages are
welcome. I also encourage participants to bring colts as young as
yearlings. Some of the basic ground training exercises that you
will&nbsp;learn at the clinics&nbsp;can&nbsp;be taught to
your
weanlings at home. <br />



    <br />



A colt starting clinic is ideal for the problem
horse even if the horse has been ridden. Problem
horses can be fixed up by taking them&nbsp;back
to square
one. These horses have problems because parts of their foundation
training has been missed or taught improperly. During the clinic we
will be able to identify which lessons where left out to
cause&nbsp;the problems your encountering.<br />



    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Learn my <span style="font-weight: bold;">24-Step Colt
Starting Program</span>.
In this program,&nbsp;you will be learning&nbsp; a
progressive step by step method which I have&nbsp;designed and
refined over years of training and teaching. Each step prepares the
horse for the next, making it easy for him to progress in a quiet and
relaxed manner.<br />



    <br />



Once you have learned the basic ground training exercises you will then
progress to developing the skill it takes to master the art of starting
colts.<br />



    <br />



Only a limited number of people are accepted into each clinic to ensure
your quality one on one instruction. <br />

horse will advance at their own speed with Daryle keeping an ever
watchful eye. Moving you on to your next step once he is sure you are
